This campaign001 implements something sikilar to old\_v1 base models using Tanaka & Ward forces in modify\_orbit\_resonance\_relax. This was dropped in favour of the more controlled constant damping timescale formulation in campaign002, which keeps period ratios constant as the chain coompresses.

Should be moved to an achive location or dropped.
